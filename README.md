# Project: Concurrency in Python  

## Description  
This project showcases practical examples for handling concurrency and parallelism in Python using threads, multiprocessing, and asynchronous programming (AsyncIO). It demonstrates scalable implementations by integrating advanced object-oriented design patterns.  

## Project Structure  
- **`src/basic/`**  
  Foundational examples of threads, multiprocessing, and AsyncIO.  
- **`src/application/`**  
  Structured task management system using interfaces, factories, and managers for processes/threads.  
- **Interfaces & Factories**  
  Abstract layers to simplify concurrent and parallel task execution.  

## Usage  
1. Install dependencies (e.g., `Pillow` for image processing).  
2. Run scripts in `src/basic/` to explore basic concurrency concepts.  
3. Check `src/application/` for advanced task management implementations.  

## Contribution  
This project serves as a learning resource and foundation for concurrent/parallel systems. Contributions, enhancements, and adaptations are encouraged.
